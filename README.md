## 7. Ethical Considerations & Limitations

### 7.1. Ethical Considerations
- **Bias & Fairness:**  
  As with any model trained on publicly available text, there is a risk of inheriting biases present in the training data. Ongoing evaluation and fine-tuning are necessary to mitigate potential biases.
- **Content Responsibility:**  
  Generated text is based solely on learned patterns and may occasionally produce inappropriate content. Responsible deployment and monitoring are essential.

### 7.2. Limitations
- **Character-Level Generation:**  
  While efficient, character-level modeling may result in less coherent outputs compared to token-level approaches.
- **Architectural Constraints:**  
  The current encoder-based design does not include causal masking, which is commonly employed in autoregressive models to better handle sequential dependencies.
- **Scalability:**  
  The lightweight architecture is optimized for quick inference but may require scaling or architectural enhancements for more complex tasks.
